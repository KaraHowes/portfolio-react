This is a pre-bootcamp project to re-build my (first) Portfolio using React; to try to utilise and harness all of the skills I acquired during the bootcamp. My aim was to break each section down into components and try to re-use code as much as possible. I opted to utilise Styled Components, a React styling library.

The deployed version can be found here on netlify:
